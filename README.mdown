# bug references across browsers

Because I was tired of always trying to find which bug from [Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), [Webkit](https://bugs.webkit.org/) and [Opera](https://bugs.opera.com/) are tied together. 

This is mainly to associate bugs for Open Web Technologies. It is not meant to cover everything in life. It is a very simple and dumb system. The bugs are contained in a very simple JSON file.

Everyone is welcome to contribute.

## JSON file format for the bugs

You can do pull requests for the bugs. The general JSON file is a list of features. So far, it tries to cover only the things that you would find in sites such as [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/)

	{
		features: [
			â€¦
			]
	}

Each feature is described by an object with

* the name of the feature
* the link to the spec
* the list of bugs for each browser

	{name: "Gamepad API", 
	 spec: "https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html", 
	 bugs: {opera: ["CORE-45220"], webkit: [69451], mozilla: [690935] }}

The bugs for each browser vendor is an array in the case, where they would be more than one meaningful number for the technology. If there is a meta-bug for the technology, please prefer this one.

For resolving webkit and mozilla bugs to their URI, you just need to extract the value(s) from the JSON DB

	var webkitval = features[0]["webkit"][0]
	"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id="+webkitval
	
	var mozval = features[0]["mozilla"][0]
	"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id="+mozval

## Notes

* **Microsoft**: We do not have access to the microsoft bug numbers. They are welcome, as anyone, to do pull requests to update the list.
* **Opera**: Opera doesn't have an open bug tracker. They are considering it. There is no release date yet.
* You are free to build your own UI with these data.
